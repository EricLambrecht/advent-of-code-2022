# Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022/

Programming language used: **Typescript** with Node.js

## Running the scripts

a) Simply run `npm run start:dev` and answer the prompt orâ€¦

b) `npm run start:dev {DAY}` to run a specific day directly.

## Windows...

For some reason, half of the days are broken on Windows and I don't know why.
Maybe it's the encoding of the input? ... hmmm...
Anyway I get broken results, buggy console outputs and wrong calculations when I run this on Windows.
